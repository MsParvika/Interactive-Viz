It would need a server to run it, as js file reads data from another source. You can get the by any of the following:

1. Chrome extension ( I used Web Server for Chrome )
- Install any chrome extension which gives you server proxy
- Point the cloned folder on the extension.

2. Eclipse IDE
- Import project on Eclipse with Apache Maven Installed
- Run it
 
 (you can use any other IDE like ItelliJ - Webstorm)

3. Install Apache Maven/Ant or any other server on local machine
- Download the project and run it on your localhost

4.Install LAMP or XAMPP Software
- Go through the respective software instructions to run a local server


Run Index.html file.
